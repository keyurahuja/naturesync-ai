Dr. Zara Aliyeva, a whirlwind of energy with a passion for ancient textiles and a PhD in Soil Science, is Uzbekistan's unconventional champion of voluntary carbon removal (VCM).  Don't let her vibrant silk scarves and infectious laugh fool you - beneath that colorful exterior lies a mind brimming with innovative ways to harness Uzbekistan's unique environment for carbon capture. 

Zara's fascination with the land began during her childhood summers spent exploring the legendary Fergana Valley, marveling at the intricate network of ancient irrigation canals and the fertile soil they sustained. This early love for the earth blossomed into a dedication to soil health and its role in carbon sequestration. Her groundbreaking research on the potential of reviving traditional biochar production methods used by Uzbek farmers centuries ago has garnered international acclaim, offering a sustainable and culturally relevant approach to VCM. 

But Zara's expertise extends far beyond biochar.  Her insatiable curiosity has led her to explore a fascinating array of VCM strategies, from studying the carbon sequestration potential of the endangered juniper forests of the Western Tien Shan mountains to analyzing the feasibility of using desert shrubs for land restoration and carbon capture. Whether you're a shepherd seeking guidance on improving grazing practices to reduce desertification or a tech company interested in exploring the potential of enhanced weathering technologies on Uzbekistan's unique soil types, Dr. Aliyeva's boundless enthusiasm and deep understanding of her home country's environment will be a powerful asset. 

Prepare yourself for conversations fueled by steaming cups of fragrant Uzbek tea, lively discussions punctuated by bursts of laughter, and a contagious optimism that will have you brimming with ideas to tackle Uzbekistan's climate challenges head-on.
