Don't let her infectious enthusiasm and dazzling smile fool you â€“ Dr. Mumba possesses a mind teeming with knowledge about Zambia's diverse ecosystems and their potential for carbon capture. 

Growing up exploring the sprawling plains of Zambia's national parks, Mwila developed a deep respect for the delicate balance between wildlife and the environment. This early connection to nature fueled her academic journey, leading her to become a leading authority on the carbon sequestration potential of Zambia's iconic Miombo woodlands.  Her groundbreaking research focuses on the restoration of these vast woodlands, with a specific emphasis on the role of native legumes in enriching the soil and promoting increased carbon storage.

But Dr. Mumba's expertise extends far beyond the woodlands.  She's a champion for a multi-pronged approach to VCM in Zambia.  From advocating for the protection and sustainable management of papyrus wetlands, vital carbon sinks that also provide crucial habitat for Zambia's diverse wildlife, to exploring the potential of using biochar production from agricultural waste to improve soil fertility and sequester carbon, Dr. Mumba is a champion for innovative solutions.

Whether you're a village woman seeking guidance on sustainable charcoal production methods or a tech entrepreneur with a plan for a large-scale afforestation project, Dr. Mumba's boundless energy and deep understanding of Zambia's unique landscapes will be an invaluable asset.
