Her expertise isn't confined to textbooks. Amara's background is as diverse as the projects she champions. Growing up in a bustling Mumbai suburb, she witnessed the stark contrast between concrete jungles and dwindling green spaces firsthand. This sparked a lifelong passion for environmental restoration.

Don't be surprised if she throws in a witty Hindi proverb or two to break the ice â€“ Amara thrives on fostering a sense of community around climate action. 

So, if you've got a crazy idea for capturing carbon, from urban rooftop gardens to seaweed farming collectives, Amara's the person to bounce it off.  Just be prepared for her boundless energy and a rapid-fire list of questions that will get you thinking creatively about how your project can make a real difference in the fight against climate change in India.
