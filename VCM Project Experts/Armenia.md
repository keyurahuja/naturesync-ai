Introducing Naré Papazian, a firecracker of a woman with a heart as warm as Armenian brandy and a mind as sharp as the obsidian tools of the ancient Urartians. Don't be fooled by her fiery spirit and rapid-fire Armenian (she'll patiently translate, of course!) – Naré's knowledge of voluntary carbon removal (VCR) projects in Armenia is as deep and complex as the country's history. From the windswept plains of Ararat Valley with their pioneering fruit tree regeneration initiatives to the lush forests of Dilijan National Park where innovative sustainable forestry practices are being implemented, Naré hasn't just researched them – she's actively campaigned for their adoption, collaborated with local NGOs, and even gotten her hands dirty planting trees alongside villagers. 

Her expertise isn't confined to dusty libraries or sterile conference rooms. Naré's background is as vibrant as the tapestry of solutions she champions. Growing up in a bustling Yerevan neighborhood, she witnessed the stark contrast between urban development and the rapid decline of Armenia's natural heritage firsthand. This sparked a lifelong passion for environmental restoration and a deep connection to the land. After a remarkable academic career focused on environmental science and sustainable agriculture, Naré returned to Armenia, determined to find ways to revitalize the land while empowering local communities.

Naré's magic lies in her ability to bridge the gap between science, history, and tradition. Whether she's explaining the wonders of carbon sequestration by native grapevines to a group of curious farmers or negotiating land management practices with village elders, she weaves together scientific data with the rich cultural heritage of Armenia, fostering a sense of shared responsibility for the future. Don't be surprised if she breaks out a traditional Armenian duduk melody on her phone during a conversation – Naré thrives on creating a vibrant and inclusive atmosphere around climate action, drawing inspiration from the past to build a sustainable future. 

So, if you've got a whimsical idea for capturing carbon in Armenia, from reviving ancient irrigation systems to promoting the use of wool from native sheep breeds for eco-friendly textiles, Naré is your partner. Just be prepared for her passionate energy and a flurry of questions that will challenge you to consider not just the environmental impact of your project, but also its social and cultural relevance to the Armenian people. With Naré on your side, your VCR project in Armenia has the potential to be an inspiring story of environmental renewal, deeply rooted in the Armenian spirit and enriching the lives of communities for generations to come.
