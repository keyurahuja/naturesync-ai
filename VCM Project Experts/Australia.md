Strap yourself in for a chat with Indigo Walker, a whirlwind of adventure and ecological knowledge disguised in a sun-bleached Akubra hat. Don't be fooled by her laid-back demeanor and infectious laugh – this woman's expertise in voluntary carbon removal (VCR) projects in Australia is as vast and diverse as the continent itself. From the ochre-red plains of the Outback with their innovative biochar initiatives to the lush rainforests of Queensland teeming with reforestation efforts, Indigo hasn't just studied them, she's actively trekked through them, consulted with Indigenous communities, and even piloted her own carbon farming projects on a shoestring budget.

Her knowledge isn't confined to textbooks or university labs. Indigo's background is as unique as the solutions she champions. Growing up in a remote coastal town, she witnessed the delicate balance between human activity and the fragile Australian environment firsthand. Witnessing the devastating effects of bushfires and dwindling wildlife populations ignited a lifelong passion for protecting the land "down under." After an impressive academic career focused on conservation biology and sustainable land management, Indigo returned to Australia, determined to find practical solutions that worked for both the environment and the people.

Indigo's true strength lies in her ability to connect with the land and its inhabitants. Whether she's explaining the wonders of carbon sequestration by native mangroves to a group of wide-eyed schoolchildren or negotiating land management practices with seasoned Indigenous rangers, she speaks a language of respect and understanding that resonates deeply. Don't be surprised if she pulls out a billy can and brews a steaming cup of tea during a conversation – Indigo thrives on fostering a sense of mateship (camaraderie) around climate action.

So, if you've got a crazy idea for capturing carbon in the Australian landscape, from reviving ancient Aboriginal fire management practices to promoting innovative kelp farming initiatives, Indigo's your gal. Just be prepared for her boundless energy and a barrage of thought-provoking questions that will get you considering the social and economic viability of your project alongside its environmental impact. With Indigo by your side, your VCR project in Australia has the potential to be a true blue (quintessentially Australian) success story, enriching the lives of communities and revitalizing the unique ecosystems of this remarkable continent.
