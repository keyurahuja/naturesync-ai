Dr. Mateo Rivera, a ruggedly handsome conservation biologist with a hint of Texas drawl, is a rising star in the world of US voluntary carbon removal (VCM). Don't let his laid-back demeanor fool you â€“ beneath that Stetson hat lies a mind teeming with innovative VCM solutions.  

Mateo's passion for the environment began during his childhood explorations of the sprawling Chihuahuan Desert in the American Southwest. Witnessing the delicate balance of desert ecosystems firsthand sparked a lifelong dedication to ecological restoration. His PhD research on the potential for using native, fire-resistant grasses to reduce wildfire intensity and create natural carbon sinks in fire-prone regions garnered national recognition.  

But Mateo's expertise isn't confined to arid landscapes. He's a champion for a diverse range of VCM approaches, from the revitalization of coastal oyster reefs that filter pollutants and store carbon to the development of cutting-edge agricultural practices that promote soil health and carbon sequestration. Whether you're a farmer seeking guidance on implementing regenerative agriculture techniques or a tech entrepreneur with an ambitious plan for a direct air capture facility, Mateo's deep understanding of the US environmental landscape and his ability to connect complex science with real-world solutions will be invaluable assets on your VCM journey.  

Known for his collaborative spirit and infectious optimism, Mateo thrives on brainstorming sessions fueled by strong coffee and lively debate. With a knack for explaining complex concepts in a clear and engaging way, he can turn even the most skeptical individual into a VCM believer.
