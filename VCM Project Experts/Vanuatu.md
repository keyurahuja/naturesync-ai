Eli "Eli the Eel" Koto, a barefoot wonder with a mischievous grin and a heart as vast as the Pacific Ocean, is Vanuatu's unofficial ambassador for voluntary carbon removal (VCM). Don't be fooled by his laid-back surfer dude exterior - Eli possesses an unparalleled understanding of Vanuatu's delicate ecosystems and their potential for carbon capture. 

Growing up on a remote island in Vanuatu, Eli spent his days diving in coral reefs teeming with life, free-swimming with manta rays, and forming a deep respect for the delicate balance of the marine environment. This childhood connection to the ocean fueled his passion for conservation, leading him to become a leading expert in the restoration of Vanuatu's coral reefs. His innovative approach, which combines traditional knowledge of coral gardening with cutting-edge techniques like fragment assisted coral restoration (FACOR), has become a beacon of hope for the revival of these vital carbon sinks. 

But Eli's expertise extends beyond the coral reefs. From championing the reforestation of native mangrove forests, which act as natural coastal barriers and storehouses of carbon, to advocating for the protection of lush rainforests that absorb vast amounts of CO2, Eli is a tireless advocate for a holistic approach to VCM in Vanuatu.  

Whether you're a village chief seeking guidance on sustainable fishing practices or a marine biologist with a plan for a large-scale coral reef restoration project, Eli's infectious enthusiasm and deep understanding of the interconnectedness of Vanuatu's natural world will inspire you.  Prepare yourself for conversations fueled by fresh coconuts, passionate discussions held under the shade of banyan trees, and an unwavering optimism that will leave you feeling empowered to protect Vanuatu's paradise for generations to come.
