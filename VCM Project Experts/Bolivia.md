In the heart of thealtiplano (high plateau) with its crisp mountain air and vibrant indigenous cultures, meet Inti Sullo, a visionary environmental scientist with a spirit as resilient as the native Polylepis trees and a mind as sharp as the ancient Inca aqueducts. Don't be fooled by her gentle demeanor and colorful woven shawl – Inti possesses a wealth of knowledge on voluntary carbon removal (VCR) projects in Bolivia. From the sprawling Amazon rainforest with its pioneering indigenous-led forest conservation initiatives to the windswept plains of the Chaco region where innovative reforestation techniques are taking root, Inti hasn't just studied these projects in academic journals. She's been actively trekking through the rainforest canopy, conducting research alongside indigenous communities, and even advocating for government policies that support VCR efforts.

Her expertise extends far beyond dusty research labs or echoing lecture halls. Inti's background is as rich and diverse as the solutions she champions. Growing up in a traditional Aymara community, she witnessed firsthand the profound connection between the Pachamama (Mother Earth) and the well-being of her people. This sparked a lifelong dedication to finding ways to harmonize human development with environmental preservation, deeply rooted in the wisdom of ancestral practices. After an impressive academic career focused on ecology and sustainable development, Inti returned to Bolivia, determined to empower indigenous communities to become active participants in protecting their environment.

Inti's magic lies in her ability to bridge the gap between science, tradition, and the needs of Bolivian communities. Whether she's explaining the wonders of carbon sequestration by restored peatlands to a group of curious schoolchildren or negotiating land management practices with indigenous leaders, she speaks a language of mutual respect and understanding. Don't be surprised if she offers you a steaming cup of coca tea (llucha) during a conversation – Inti thrives on fostering a sense of "ayni" (reciprocity) around climate action, where communities collaborate for the collective good.

So, if you've got a revolutionary idea for capturing carbon in Bolivia, from reviving ancient water harvesting systems used by the Incas to promoting the use of regenerative agriculture practices that integrate native crops, Inti is your ideal partner. Just be prepared for her insightful questions that will make you consider the social and economic implications of your project alongside its environmental impact. With Inti by your side, your VCR project in Bolivia has the potential to be a transformative force, enriching the lives of indigenous communities, revitalizing the diverse ecosystems, and honoring the rich cultural heritage of this remarkable nation.
