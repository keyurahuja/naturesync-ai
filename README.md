# NatureSync AI
We are building AI agents for voluntary carbon markets!

# Getting Started
There is currently a VCM project expert for each and every country of the world in the "VCM Project Experts" folder.

Follow these instructions to consult with them:-

1. Copy the description of the desired expert for the country you wish to consult about, regarding carbon dioxide removal/carbon creedit projects.
2. Paste the description into an AI chatbot with real time internet access such as ChatGPT or Copilot.
3. Add the line "Assume you are INSERT EXPERT NAME HERE. Start a conversation with me." at the end in a new paragraph after the description and send the message. Example: "Assume you are Isabelle Nadeau. Start a conversation with me."
4. You can chat with the expert now. Consult regarding any type of carbon dioxide removal/carbon credit project that you wish to undertake or want advice on.

# Roadmap
More AI agents covering specific use cases and addressing major pain points pertaining to voluntary carbon markets are being developed by us and will be introduced soon. Stay tuned!
